# HF Social
HF Social is a full-stack content management platform designed to help businesses and individuals maintain a consistent, high-quality social media presence across Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram. It leverages a context-aware AI chatbot to accelerate content creation and uses a robust scheduling worker to ensure reliable, compliant automatic publishing.

The platform was built to meet the Humanity Founders Full Stack Challenge objectives by seamlessly integrating content generation, calendar scheduling, and posting automation into one simple interface.
Key Features and Compliance
1. Context-Aware AI Chatbot (Content Generation)
Our AI model goes beyond generic output by retaining and utilizing a business context profile (industry, voice, audience). This allows it to generate content that is personalized, relevant, and avoids sounding "too AI-generated," focusing on a genuine tone as requested.

Generation Types: Supports drafting text-only posts, and posts requiring image/video captions.

2. Full-Stack Scheduling & Calendar
The platform provides a single calendar interface for viewing and managing all scheduled posts across multiple platforms.

Post Status Visuals: Posts are clearly color-coded on the calendar based on status (Draft, Scheduled, Published, Failed).

Editing Gateway: Users can select any scheduled post to access the Review and Edit Modal, fulfilling the requirement to modify content before publication.

Post Types: Supports marking posts as Dynamic (prompting engagement) or Static (visual content).

3. Reliable Posting Automation (The Worker Service)
A dedicated, independent Node-Cron worker runs in the backend to ensure posts are published precisely at the scheduled time.

Compliance: The system uses a dedicated Social Media Service Layer to isolate API calls, ensuring platform guidelines are followed and rate limits are respected to prevent account bans.

Reliability: The worker marks posts as Published only after confirming API success on the target platform, and marks them Failed if a posting attempt is unsuccessful.
